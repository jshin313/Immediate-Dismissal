# Immediate-Dismissal
A repo with my badly coded Android app to help you know when you're out of the BWSI boundaries

Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) is a summer program that offers several hands-on project based courses. Many of the courses are pretty interesting and actually provide some interesting material to learn. BWSI also allows students to stay on campus as residential students, however, these students are restricted to only a certain area on and around the campus. Access to other areas is prohibited and leaving the boundaries is grounds for "immediate dismissal."
